It is raining cats and dogs near the Golden Gate Bridge. Protect the
balloon from cats and dogs by dragging the balloon. They are just free
falling but you will need a lot of reflex and agility to survive in
this cuteness overflowing game. Just try to survive the game until the
song ends! It is just a few minutes.
